made this since I was bored during quarantine, as a way to apply what I learned during that time.
Uses caesar cipher, and beaufort to make text files unreadable
note that this takes a while for large files exceeding 50Mb, taking up to 150Mb of RAM as well.
currently, XOR does not work as intended for decrypting text files. don't use it.
